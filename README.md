# Friends help friends code! 
A repo to collaborate with Autumn to help learn some practical python! 

WELLL!! :wave: :wave:

## What is this? 

This is a git repo we will use to go through some python concepts while actually building something. We will go from creating a simple CLI tool, to an app with a UI and a Database. 

## Getting Started

First things first. This repo is in github. You will need to clone it. You can use the github [desktop UI](https://desktop.github.com/) to help you work with git or use the [git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads). I use both for different things.  

Git is a tool. 

Github is a product that allows people to store their git repositories on the internet. 

We can dig more into this in person! 

For now just install CLI or Github Desktop to allow you to clone the repository to your local machine. 

We may need to set up some SSH Keys for you before you can do this. See details [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) if you want to get a head start or we can meet to get this set up! 

Once you have the repo cloned, open the `todo-cli` folder in your command line and type `python main.py`. You should see a welcome message basic instructions. Type "Add" to add a todo item. Type "Exit" to exit when your done adding items. Thats all thats functional at the minute. You will build the rest (with my help of course!)
